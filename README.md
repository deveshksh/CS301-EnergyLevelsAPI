Objective: To develop Digital-based future energies

Theme : Evolution of digitalisation in the energy sector:
The energy sector is now in a profound transition towards a very important energy
transformation, and digitalisation is one of the key facilitators to ensure that it is fulfilled. In
the recent past, companies started by switching the use of analogue meters to digital meters,
smart meters etc., in order to improve energy efficiency.
Digitalisation acts as a lever in the sector to combat climate change and optimise power
generation processes to reduce emissions and meet the objective of decarbonisation of the
energy model.
Indeed, digitalisation has brought about a significant transformation in the energy sector, enabling greater efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness. The evolution of digitalisation in the energy sector can be traced back to the use of digital meters, which replaced traditional analogue meters. These smart meters have made it easier to track energy consumption and provide consumers with more detailed information about their energy usage, leading to greater energy efficiency and cost savings.

Beyond the use of smart meters, the energy sector has been transformed by a range of digital technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies have enabled greater control and optimisation of power generation processes, helping to reduce emissions and meet the objective of decarbonisation of the energy model. For example, advanced data analytics can help utilities predict and respond to changes in demand, allowing them to optimise their generation capacity and avoid costly blackouts.
